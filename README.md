# Microsoft Edge Developer Tools for Visual Studio Code

**Show the browser's Elements and Network tool inside the Visual Studio Code editor and use it to fix CSS issues with your site and inspect network activity.**

A Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to use the browser's Elements and Network tool from within the editor. The DevTools will connect to an instance of Microsoft Edge giving you the ability to see the runtime HTML structure, alter layout, fix styling issues, read console messages and view network requests. All without leaving Visual Studio Code.

**Note**: This extension _only_ supports Microsoft Edge (version greater than 80.0.361.48)

You can use the extension either in an own window or embedded in your editor.
