## Development setup
* Clone this repo
* Run `npm install` in '/vscode-edge-devtools'
* Download and Extract Edge source files
  * run `npm run download-edge`
    * If this step fails, see [Legacy Source File Setup](#legacy-source-file-setup)
    * See [Building with different Edge versions](#building-with-different-edge-versions) to target other versions of Edge
  * The files will be saved at `\vscode-edge-debug\out\edge`
* Run `npm run build` or `npm run watch` in '/vscode-edge-devtools'
* Open the directory in VS Code
* Select `Launch Extension` debug configuration
* Press `F5` to launch the VS Code extension host environment and debug the extension
* The extension should appear on the left sidebar.  Click the Edge icon on the sidebar to access the extension.

Here are a list of recommended VS Code extensions to use when developing for vscode-edge-devtools:
* [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
* [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin)

## Building with different Edge versions
* Navigate to the root extension directory
* Run `node scripts/downloadAndExtractEdge [VERSION_NUMBER]` where `[VERSION_NUMBER]` is a version of Edge
  * The current set of accepted `[VERSION_NUMBER]` values is 83, 84 and 85.  Other numbers will target the currently supported version.
  * To target other versions that this script does not support, see [Legacy Source File Setup](#legacy-source-file-setup).
* This replaces the `npm run download-edge` script in the setup instructions, follow the rest of the instructions to complete setup.

## Legacy Source File Setup
Use this method if the automated methods fail or if the desired version is not supported by the download script.
* Download a copy of the Microsoft Edge build from [https://thirdpartysource.microsoft.com](https://thirdpartysource.microsoft.com), current extension version builds from version 84.0.522.63.
  * Note: Download the 'Microsoft Edge DevTools' zip if available in the desired version and platform - it will be much faster.
* Extract the necessary files from the zip
  * On an administrator prompt execute the following commands (assuming your drive is located at C:\)
    * **Windows**: `mkdir [PATH_TO_EXTENSION]\vscode-edge-devtools\out\edge\src\out\Release\gen\devtools&&mkdir [PATH_TO_EXTENSION]\out\edge\src\third_party\devtools-frontend\src\front_end`
    * **Mac/Linux**: `mkdir -p [PATH_TO_EXTENSION]/vscode-edge-devtools/out/edge/src/out/Release/gen/devtools&&mkdir -p [PATH_TO_EXTENSION]/out/edge/src/third_party/devtools-frontend/src/front_end`
  * **Open** the zip file and (inside the zip file) navigate to:
    * `[COMPRESSED_FILE]\src\third_party\devtools-frontend\src\front_end`
    * copy the contents of the "front_end" folder and paste them into `[PATH_TO_EXTENSION]/vscode-edge-devtools/out/edge/src/third_party/devtools-frontend/src/front_end`
  * **Open** the zip file and (inside the zip file) navigate to:
    * `[COMPRESSED_FILE]\src\out\Release\gen\devtools`
    * copy the contents of the "devtools" folder and paste them into `[PATH_TO_EXTENSION]/vscode-edge-devtools/out/edge/src/out/Release/gen/devtools`

## Testing
* There are a set of jest tests which can be run with `npm run test`.
* You may also run `npm run lint` separately to check your code against our tslint rules.
* Open the directory in VS Code
* Select `Launch Tests` debug configuration
* Press `F5` to attach the debugger and start the tests

## Issue tags
* "Bug": Something that should work is broken
* "Enhancement": AKA feature request - adds new functionality
* "Task": Something that needs to be done that doesn't really fix anything or add major functionality. Tests, engineering, documentation, etc.
